# valo-gateway Governance

Status: draft-governance, 2026-08-21

This file defines how normative valo-gateway changes move from idea to versioned release and how canonical authority changes if an external publisher, standards body or community governance process later takes over.

## 1. Current editorial authority

Until an explicit transfer is recorded, this repository is the canonical public reference-enforcement surface and Njål Gaute Solland acts as the specification editor/maintainer.

The editor may merge changes only through the process below. Repository ownership is not permission to silently change normative meaning.

## 2. Discussion is not specification

GitHub Discussions, issues, papers, workshops, partner feedback and external review are proposal/evidence surfaces.

They are non-normative until a change is incorporated into a versioned release through an accepted change proposal.

No statement in a discussion thread, paper draft, presentation or external correspondence silently changes the normative contract.

## 3. Change proposal record

Every normative change requires a public change record containing:

- stable proposal ID;
- problem/rationale;
- proposed normative text;
- affected contracts/enforcement behavior;
- compatibility class;
- security impact;
- conformance impact and negative cases;
- migration impact;
- external references/evidence;
- decision and decision date;
- target version.

The GitHub issue or pull request number may serve as the proposal ID while this repository remains the canonical venue.

## 4. Change classes and versioning

valo-gateway uses semantic versioning for meaning:

- MAJOR: breaking change to existing contracts or enforcement semantics;
- MINOR: substantive additive requirement, optional field/profile, or expanded surface;
- PATCH: clarification/correction that does not change enforcement requirements.

Prerelease drafts use immutable forward-only identifiers such as `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-draft.N`. Historical tags are never moved, deleted or retargeted.

## 5. Acceptance gates

A normative proposal may be accepted only when:

1. the compatibility class is explicit;
2. affected contracts are identified;
3. required negative conformance behavior is specified;
4. security and migration impact are recorded;
5. public text is implementation-neutral and does not leak private runtime/IP;
6. validation/CI checks are green on the exact head;
7. the changelog records the change and target version.

A change may be technically implemented privately before acceptance. Private implementation does not itself make the public contract normative.

## 6. Editorial vs normative changes

Editorial changes may correct spelling, links, formatting and non-normative explanation without a minor/major bump if they do not alter required behavior.

If reasonable implementers could behave differently because of a text change, treat it as normative.

## 7. Transfer to an external standards body

If an external standards body, foundation, consortium or other governance venue becomes the normative authority:

1. record the transfer explicitly in this file;
2. identify the external canonical registry and effective version/date;
3. tag/freeze the last repository-owned normative release;
4. change this repository's role to reference implementation or mirror as applicable;
5. maintain an explicit mapping between external normative versions and local artifacts;
6. do not claim two simultaneous canonical sources for the same normative contract.

## 8. Emergency security changes

A security issue may be privately coordinated before disclosure. The resulting change still requires a public decision record and forward version/changelog entry once disclosure is safe.

Security urgency may shorten review time; it does not remove provenance or versioning requirements.

## 9. Decision provenance

For every published release, the release tag/hash plus changelog and accepted proposal history together form the provenance record.

The rule is simple:

> Discussion proposes. Evidence informs. Maintainers edit. A versioned accepted release decides.
